# 1395510_Portfoli_CH2

## Description

This is the second challenge of the UofU bootcamp which requires us to build a portfolio using the HTML and CSS skills we'v learned thus far.

I built this project, 1. because it was an assignment, 2. I wanted to challenge myself and try to utilize the skills that I've learned so far. I realized quickly that there is still alot I do not know, but this project quickly cultivated my skills. I feel more accomplished at the end of it. Do to this project being one that is built from scratch, I feel more in tune with the skills that have been tought and I feel that I could potentially be a good developer in the future.

## Credits

My main credit is the UofU bootcamp resources, but also Jace Edwards for his help in learning flexbox operations!


## Features

This project has a few features due to the limitation of my knowledge. Mainly linking websites to my portfolio for review and my contact information having links in case you need to get in tough with me.


## Tests

1. Portfolio loads - You should see a working webiste with pictures loading due to correct file path locations
2. Click on the nav links in the top right corner, this will direct you to any of the three sections you choose
3. I currently only have one assignment to link to my portfolio, which I made my biggest picture in the "work" section. Please choose this project and it will direct you to the github pages I made it for it.
4. I built this project to adapt to your view port. 
    - After you go below the width for the "L mobile" viewport then my projects should stack in a column fashion. The contact information should be a punnett square formation. 
    - Once you go to tablet resolution the nav links fall under the h1 header and the headers should be on top of their section they represent. My profile picture will disappear as I couldn't find a good way to format it.
5. In the contact me section, I've linked my github and linkedin profile. Select either of these and you will be directed to my profile on the sites.
